          <p>
            Ross Evans is a man transported to another world, the Original World where all other worlds began.
            He is caught in a battle for all existence and must choose between the man he was and the man he is becoming.

          <p>
            Princess Sarai—or just Sara to her close friends—has been fighting this battle for as long as she can remember.
            She keeps her identity a secret from Ross. She wants him to see her for the woman she is, not her title.
            She is the person all look to for strength.

          <p>
            Drazzo is the last remaining First Wizard. He is the one everyone turns to when things are darkest.
            He saved the people in Safehaven by creating a place where they could seek refuge from the destruction
            constantly unleashed by The First.

          <h3 class="book-title">The First (Chron)</h3>
          <p>
            Chron is the original God, the creator of everything. Most have taken to just calling him The First.
            When he realized he had given mankind the ability to create other worlds and Gods, he set himself on a path
            to destroy it all for nothing more than jealousy. He was never able to simply destroy it, because it was no longer his
            to destroy. He was defeated a thousand years ago and lost most of his power, but he has returned with a stronger desire
            to see it wiped from existence.
